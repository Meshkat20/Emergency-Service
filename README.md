Ans to Q !. ==  getElementByID is used when we have to select only one element. so give an id to that element in html and then we can select in js by getElementById
                gatElementsByClassName is used when we have to select a group of element or more than one element then we use getElementByClassName. we give a common class name to all the elements we want to select then we select in js by getElementsbyClassName
                querySelector selects the first element that mathches the Css selector. so these are the differences
