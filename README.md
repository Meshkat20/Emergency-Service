Ans to Q !. ==  getElementByID is used when we have to select only one element. so give an id to that element in html and then we can select in js by getElementById
                gatElementsByClassName is used when we have to select a group of element or more than one element then we use getElementByClassName. we give a common class name to all the elements we want to select then we select in js by getElementsbyClassName
                querySelector selects the first element that mathches the Css selector. so these are the differences
                
Ans to Q-2 == We create a new element in to the DOM using document.createElement().. and between the brackets we can add element.  To insert an element in to the DOM we use appendchild() / prepend()/ insertBefore() / append()

Ans to Q-3 ==  When an event occurs on an element, it does not just trigger on that element. it bubbles up to the DOM tree. the event starts at the target element and then moves upward to its parent, grand parent and so on. all the way to the document object. it works like                 if anyone clicks on a child element then child element is clicket first then the parent element. this is how it works.
Ans to Q-4 ==
